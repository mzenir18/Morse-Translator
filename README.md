# Morse-Translator


Morse  Translator is a program coverts English text to Morse code and vice versa.
The text should be read from a file and output should be written to another. 



## Prerequisites

you should install the unit testing framework  using pip in the Terminal 

```
pip install unittest
```
## Morse syntax
Morse code expresses characters as pulses of different durations.Short signals are referred to as "dots", long signals as "dashes".
 We'll refer to "dots" as the character "•" and "dashes" as "-".and the following table will be our dictionary IMAGE
 In this program each charcter of Morse code should be separated with a dot "."  
example we have in English 
```
sos
```
the result after translation should be 
```
•••.−−−.•••
```
In addition the words are separated with a normal space " " as the following example shows 
```
hello world
```
would be :
```
••••.•.•-••.•-••.--- •--.---.•-•.•-••.-•• 
```
